*Breaking News--*

The Knight Foundation Fund at the Wichita Community Foundation has awarded Wichita Festivals, Inc. $25,000 for the River Festival Hackathon coming in summer of 2016. The Hackathon, an official River Festival event, will be an intense 24-hour session of collaboration between a diverse groups of participants culminating in the opportunity to pitch the final ideas to a distinguished group of judges, including Mayor Longwell.

Needless to say, we're all pretty excited.

Also notable is the $65,390 grant going to KMUW for their EngageICT program, which will host a series of public meetings during the 2016 election year. You'll remember from [a previous post](http://openwichita.com/open-wichita-partners-with-kmuw-89-1-on-voter-turnout/) that we plan to partner with KMUW and the EngageICT initiative by developing a platform that enables voters to be more easily informed on the local issues that affect their lives and through that, increase turnout at the polls.

Read more details about the five organizations that received a grant in this [Wichita Business Journal article](http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/news/2015/12/08/wichita-community-foundation-announces-knight.html).

In other news, Open Wichita is making news. 

[This Feature Article in the Wichita Eagle by Kelsey Ryan](http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article47093260.html) recently gave the Wichita community a primer on what we're all about, and it has gained some significant social traction.

Also, this encouraging [editorial by Rhonda Holman](http://www.kansas.com/opinion/editorials/article48054705.html), published in the Wichita Eagle, reinforces the need for open data and greater government transparency.
