We're doing something here in Wichita that hasn't been done before, it's called a **Civic Hackathon**. It's likely that someone may not know exactly what a civic hackathon is, so I'm going to do my best to explain.

But wait a second…

## Isn't hacking illegal?

Not this kind.

I like to define a **hack** as a creative solution to a problem. We've all heard of Life Hacks, right? Those are little things you can do to make improvements in your life.

In this case, a **civic hack** is a creative idea that makes an improvement to the city or community you are a part of.

This idea of civic hacking is spreading around the country through groups like [Code For America](https://codeforamerica.org) (also, we happen to be a [Code For America brigade](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/Open-Wichita/)).

Individuals around the country are getting together to work on fun and interesting projects that provide value to the world around them. Now it's Wichita's turn.

## So, what is a hackathon?

A hackathon is an event where a bunch of people get together to see what kind of cool things they can create in a short period of time.

So, by extension, a "civic hackathon" is the same thing but where the projects are civic in nature. "Civic" can be fairly loosely defined though. If your project has a positive impact on the world, then it fits.

### Who should attend a civic hackathon?

Anyone who wants to work on something interesting and impactful.
It doesn't matter what your background or skill set is. All skills are needed.

* Developers to build the technology,
* Designers to make it look good,
* Marketers to promote,
* Business minds to scale,
* and, every kind of subject matter expert for specific project focus.

==If you want to be a part of creating something interesting that makes a difference for our community, this is the place for you.==
